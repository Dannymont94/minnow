## Description
Is front-end design not your strong suit? Do you visit sites and wish you could remember how they looked for future reference? 

Well, now you can! Minnow is here to motivate you and improve your front-end development skills. Simply create an account, enter the URL of a website along with a description, and Minnow will take a screenshot of that site and save it to your account. Prefer to use a picture as inspiration? Minnow can help with that, too. Upload your own image to use as reference and save it to your account.

You can also click the heart below any post to save it to your favorites and have an easy reference to posts created by other users.

With Minnow, remembering website designs, layouts, and styling is a thing of the past!
